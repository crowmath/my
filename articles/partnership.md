# Partnership

## üìò Types of Partnership

### üîπ Simple Partnership
When all partners invest the **same capital for different time periods** or **different capital for the same time**.

### üîπ Compound Partnership
When all partners invest **different capital for different periods**.

---

## üë• Types of Partners

- **Active Partner**: Invests money and participates in the business. Also receives a salary from the profit.
- **Sleeping Partner**: Only invests money and does not participate in business activities.

## üßÆ Basic Formula

Profit is distributed in the ratio of:
```
Profit ‚àù Capital √ó Time
```

Thus,
```
P‚ÇÅ / P‚ÇÇ = (C‚ÇÅ √ó T‚ÇÅ) / (C‚ÇÇ √ó T‚ÇÇ)
```

---

## üìù Examples

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 1: Equal Time Investment
> Deepa and Ziya invest ‚Çπ50,000 and ‚Çπ40,000 respectively.  
Since time is the same,  
Profit Ratio = 50,000 : 40,000 = **5:4**

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 2: Different Time Periods
> Kapil invests ‚Çπ50,000, and Monu joins after 3 months with ‚Çπ70,000.  
Profit is shared as:
```
Kapil: 50000 √ó 12 = 600000  
Monu: 70000 √ó 9 = 630000  
Ratio = 600000 : 630000 = 20:21
```

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 3: Change in Capital Midway
> X and Y invest in the ratio 3:5. After 5 months:
- X increases capital by 50%
- Y reduces capital by 60%

Let original capitals be 30x and 50x.

Then:
```
X: (30x √ó 5) + (45x √ó 7) = 150x + 315x = 465x  
Y: (50x √ó 5) + (20x √ó 7) = 250x + 140x = 390x  
Profit ratio = 465 : 390 = 31 : 26  
Share of X = (31 / (31 + 26)) √ó ‚Çπ6.84L = ‚Çπ3.72L
```

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 4: Distribution After Charity

> A & B invest in the ratio 3:2. 5% profit is donated to charity. A receives ‚Çπ855.

After charity:
```
Remaining Profit = 95%
Let total = x  
A's share = (3/5) √ó 95% of x = 855  
Solve to get: x = ‚Çπ1500
```

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 5: Profit Distribution ‚Äì Mixed Rule

> A & B invest ‚Çπ30,000 and ‚Çπ20,000 respectively.  
80% of profit is shared equally, 20% in investment ratio.  
Difference in profit share = ‚Çπ4000

Let total profit = 100 units  
Equal share = 40 units each  
Ratio part: 3:2 ‚Üí A gets 12, B gets 8  
A = 52 units, B = 48 units ‚Üí Diff = 4 units = ‚Çπ4000  
1 unit = ‚Çπ1000  
Total profit = ‚Çπ1,00,000  
A's share = ‚Çπ52,000  
B's share = ‚Çπ48,000

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Example 6: Active Partner with Management Fee

> Nasir (‚Çπ75,000) is active and Rohit (‚Çπ76,000) is sleeping partner.  
Total profit = ‚Çπ880  
Nasir gets 15% of profit = ‚Çπ132  
Remaining = ‚Çπ748  
Shared in capital ratio: 75:76  
Nasir‚Äôs share = ‚Çπ132 + (75 / 151 √ó 748) ‚âà ‚Çπ472

## üß† Crow Techniques (Shortcut Methods)

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Core Formula

```
Profit Ratio = Capital √ó Time
```

Always multiply investment by time for all partners before comparing ratios.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. When Time is Same

Profit is shared in ratio of capitals directly:
```
P‚ÇÅ : P‚ÇÇ = C‚ÇÅ : C‚ÇÇ
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. When Capital is Same

Profit is shared in the ratio of time:
```
P‚ÇÅ : P‚ÇÇ = T‚ÇÅ : T‚ÇÇ
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. For New Partner Joining Later

Multiply:
```
Profit share ‚àù Investment √ó Duration of Investment
```

Adjust time in months if different partners join at different times.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Change in Investment During Business

Break into segments:
- Multiply each capital with corresponding time
- Add segments for each partner

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Distribution After Deductions (Charity/Management Fee)

- Subtract fixed portion first (e.g., 5% charity)
- Distribute remainder in agreed ratios

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Salary to Working Partner

- Deduct salary from total profit first
- Distribute the rest based on capital ratio

---

### ‚úÖ 8. Unknown Total Profit from Individual Share

Use proportion logic:
```
Individual share = (Ratio Part / Total Ratio) √ó Remaining Profit
```

---

## üìå Summary

| Situation | Shortcut |
|----------|----------|
| Equal Time | Use Capital Ratio |
| Equal Capital | Use Time Ratio |
| Mixed | Use Capital √ó Time |
| Mid-Year Entry | Adjust time and apply |
| Salary/Charity | Deduct before dividing |
| Complex Splits | Break into ratio + equal parts |
