## Mixture

## 🧪 What is a Mixture?

A **mixture** is made by combining two or more substances.  
In math problems, this usually involves mixing milk and water, or different alloys, or acids and water.

---

## 📊 Common Terms

- **Milk and Water / Acid and Water** — Usually given in a ratio (like 3:2)
- **Replacement** — When some part of mixture is removed and replaced with another
- **Alligation** — A method to find mixing ratios for two or more ingredients

---

## 🔹 Concept 1: Mixing Quantities with Known Ratios

If you mix two items with different quantities and ratios:
- Use **ratio method** or **alligation rule** to find the new ratio

### Example:
Milk:Water = 1:3  
Add x liters of milk → New ratio = 7:15  
Then add 50 liters of water → New ratio = 2:5  
You can solve by setting up ratios and using equations to find `x`

---

## 🔹 Concept 2: Replacement (Equal Quantity)

If you remove some amount and replace it with another substance:

### Formula:
```
Final quantity = Initial × (1 - p/x)ⁿ
```
Where:  
- `p` = amount removed  
- `x` = total volume  
- `n` = number of times replacement done

### Example:
90 L of milk → remove 18 L and replace with water → 3 times  
Milk left = `90 × (1 - 18/90)³ = 90 × (72/90)³ ≈ 46.08 L`

---

## 🔹 Concept 3: Replacement (Unequal Quantity)

If amounts removed each time are different:
- Do the calculation in steps using the formula for each

### Example:
From 90 L milk, remove 18 L, then 15 L, then 10 L → replace with water  
Final milk left ≈ use successive formulas to calculate step-by-step

---

## 🔹 Concept 4: Finding Initial Quantity

Sometimes you're given the final mixture ratio and asked to find the **initial quantity**.

Use this formula:
```
Milk Initial : Milk Final = (a + b) : a
```
Where `a:b` is the final ratio.

## 🔹 Concept 5: Mixing Two Mixtures

Use **alligation method**:
1. Place the ratio of first mixture on left
2. Second on right
3. Desired mixture ratio in the middle

### Example:

Milk:Water in A = 3:2  
Milk:Water in B = 6:5  
Target Mixture = 4:3  
Use milk part only:  
→ Use alligation to find the ratio in which A and B are to be mixed

---

## 🔹 Concept 6: Alloy Mixing

Copper:Zinc in A = 3:4  
Copper:Zinc in B = 5:9  
Mix A and B in ratio 3:2 → Find Copper:Zinc in the final mix  
→ Use proportion of each part and add

---

## 🔹 Concept 7: Value-Based Mixture (Tea, Milk, Coins)

Use cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) to find the ratio using alligation.

### Example:

Mix tea costing ₹60/kg and ₹65/kg  
Sell at ₹68.20/kg with 10% profit  
→ Cost price of mixture = ₹62  
Use alligation:
```
60       65  
  \     /
   \   /
    62  
   /   \
  3     2
→ Mix in ratio 3:2
```

## 🧠 Crow Techniques (Shortcuts)

---

### ✅ Trick 1: Milk-Water Replacement Fast Formula

```
Final qty = x × (1 - p/x)ⁿ
```

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Use Alligation for Quick Ratio

When two mixtures are to be combined to get a desired mix:
```
A%     B%  
  \   /
   M%  
  /   \
Diff2  Diff1  
→ Ratio = Diff2 : Diff1
```

---

### ✅ Trick 3: Use Total Units Method

If given ratios, convert them to total units and solve.

**Example:**  
Milk:Water = 2:3 → Total 5 units  
Multiply both by common volume or required value

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Adjust by LCM

To compare or combine mixtures with different denominators, use **LCM** to equalize quantities.

---

### ✅ Trick 5: Initial Quantity Formula

For two-time replacements, use:
```
Final = Initial × [(x - p1)/x] × [(x - p2)/x] × ...
```

---

### ✅ Trick 6: For Value/Profit Problems

If selling at profit/loss and want to mix values:
- Use Alligation on CP or SP
- Profit % on left, loss % on right, net profit/loss in center
