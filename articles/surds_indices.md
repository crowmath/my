# Simplification and Surds & Indices

---

## 🧮 What is Simplification?

Simplification means making a math problem easy to solve by using the right order:
- First solve inside brackets
- Then multiplication or division
- Then addition or subtraction

### 🔹 BODMAS Rule

```
B - Brackets  
O - Orders (powers or square roots)  
D - Division  
M - Multiplication  
A - Addition  
S - Subtraction
```

---

## 🔗 Types of Brackets

1. **()** Small Bracket  
2. **{}** Curly Bracket  
3. **[]** Square Bracket  
4. **Bar/Vinculum** Line above or below numbers

### 🧾 Example:

Solve:  
`25 - [16 - {14 - [8 - 3]}]`  
→ `25 - [16 - {14 - [5]}]`  
→ `25 - [16 - {9}]`  
→ `25 - [7] = 18`

## 📘 What are Indices?

**Indices** (also called exponents or powers) tell us how many times a number is multiplied by itself.

**Example:**  
3² = 3 × 3 = 9  
2⁴ = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16

---

## 📗 What are Surds?

A **Surd** is a square root number that can't be simplified into a whole number.

**Examples of surds:**  
√2, √3, √5 are surds  
But √4 = 2 is **not** a surd because 2 is a whole number.

---

## 🔐 Laws of Indices (Rules)

1. **aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ**  
2. **(aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ**  
3. **a⁰ = 1** (any number power 0 is 1)  
4. **a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ**  
5. **(a × b)ⁿ = aⁿ × bⁿ**  
6. **(a/b)ⁿ = aⁿ / bⁿ**

## 💡 Rationalization of Surds

To remove a square root from the bottom (denominator), we multiply by the same value with opposite sign.

### Example:

```
1 / (√3 + 2)  
→ Multiply by (√3 - 2) / (√3 - 2)  
→ (√3 - 2) / [(√3)² - 2²] = (√3 - 2) / (3 - 4) = (√3 - 2) / -1  
→ Answer: -(√3 - 2)
```

## 📊 Infinite Root Series Tricks

### 🔹 Type 1: Addition Inside Repeating Roots

If the expression looks like:

```
√(a + √(a + √(a + ...)))
```

→ Let a = m × n, where m and n are two consecutive numbers  
→ Answer is the **larger number**

**Example:**
```
√(56 + √(56 + √(56 + ...)))  
Since 56 = 7 × 8 → Answer is 8
```

---

### 🔹 Type 2: Subtraction Inside Repeating Roots

If the expression looks like:

```
√(a - √(a - √(a - ...)))
```

→ Let a = m × n, where m and n are two consecutive numbers  
→ Answer is the **smaller number**

**Example:**
```
√(90 - √(90 - √(90 - ...)))  
Since 90 = 9 × 10 → Answer is 9
```

## 📐 Comparing Surds

### Rule:

If the product of the square root numbers is the same:
- The expression with the **larger sum** is greater

**Example:**  
Compare:  
- √8 + √3  
- √6 + √4

Products: 8×3 = 24, 6×4 = 24 → Same  
Now compare sums:  
- √8 + √3 ≈ 2.83 + 1.73 = 4.56  
- √6 + √4 ≈ 2.45 + 2 = 4.45  
→ So √8 + √3 is greater

# 🧠 Crow Techniques (Fast Shortcuts)

### ✅ Trick 1: Convert Decimal into Fraction

**Example:**  
0.5353… = 53 / 99  
0.573 = 573 / 990  
→ Match repeating digits to 9s and non-repeating to 0s

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Infinite Root Series

Use when expressions repeat like:
```
√(a + √(a + √(a + ...))) → Answer is the bigger of two numbers that multiply to a  
√(a - √(a - √(a - ...))) → Answer is the smaller
```

---

### ✅ Trick 3: Apply Laws of Indices

- a² × a³ = a⁵  
- a⁵ ÷ a² = a³  
- (a³)² = a⁶

Use these to quickly combine or break down expressions.

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Rationalize Smartly

When denominator has a surd like √5 + √3:  
→ Multiply by √5 - √3 on top and bottom

---

### ✅ Trick 5: Use BODMAS and Simplify Brackets Step-by-Step

Always solve innermost brackets first, especially when there are square roots or exponents involved.

---

### ✅ Trick 6: Compare Surds Smartly

- If the product of two terms is same, then the one with the **greater sum** is greater  
- If difference is same, then the one with the **smaller product** is greater
