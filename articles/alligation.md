## 🧪 What is Alligation?

**Alligation** is a shortcut method used to:
- Mix two or more items with different values
- Find their ratio in the final mixture

It is often used for:
- Mixing milk and water
- Combining different alloys
- Finding average values
- Discount, profit/loss, population problems

---

## 🔢 How Alligation Works

We write:
- Higher value on the left
- Lower value on the right
- Desired/mean value in the middle

Then subtract diagonally and simplify the ratio.

### 💡 Basic Formula:

```
Higher value     Lower value  
        \         /  
         \       /  
     Mean value  
         /       \  
        /         \  
  Difference    Difference  
→ Final Ratio = Difference of opposite side values
```

### 🧊 Example 1: Mixture of Milk and Water

Milk:Water in A = 3:2 → Milk part = 3/5  
Milk:Water in B = 6:5 → Milk part = 6/11  
Target ratio = 4:3 → Milk part = 4/7  

Use alligation with milk parts:
```
A (3/5)      B (6/11)  
       \      /
      (4/7)
       /      \
Difference → Ratio A:B
```

After simplifying, you get the required mixing ratio.

### 🛢️ Example 2: Alloy Mixture

Alloy A (Cu:Zn) = 3:4  
Alloy B (Cu:Zn) = 5:9  
Final Ratio = 2:3

Let’s take Cu proportion:
A = 3/7, B = 5/14, Target = 2/5  
Use alligation with these values to get the mixing ratio.

### 💰 Example 3: Profit and Loss

Mix two types of tea costing ₹60 and ₹65.  
Selling price = ₹68.20 with 10% profit  
→ CP of mixture = 68.20 / 1.1 = ₹62

Now:
```
60       65  
   \     /
    62  
   /     \
   3     2
→ Mix in 3:2 ratio
```

### 🧾 Example 4: Discount

2 Watches sold with 8% and 15% discount  
Total marked price = ₹2100  
Overall discount = 12%

Use:
```
8       15  
   \    /
    12  
   /    \
   3     4  
→ MP ratio = 3:4
```

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Example 5: Population Increase

Male ↑ 7%, Female ↑ 10%, Overall ↑ 9.5%

Use:
```
7       10  
   \    /
    9.5  
   /    \
   0.5    2.5  
→ Ratio = 5:1 (Female:Male)
```

## 📊 Real-Life Examples

- **Income & Saving**:
  Income ↓ 6%, Expenses ↓ 8%, Saving ↑ 4%  
  Use alligation to find initial ratio of savings and expenses.

- **Interest Rate**:
  Invest ₹40,000 at 9.5% and 5.5%, got ₹3,200 interest  
  Use alligation to find ratio of amount in each bank.

- **Bowling Average**:
  Bowler gives 40 runs in 5 wickets, average changes from 11.5 to 11.  
  Use alligation to find total wickets before this match.

## 🧠 Crow Techniques (Shortcuts)

---

### ✅ Trick 1: Use Differences for Ratio

Just subtract diagonally:

```
High   Low  
  \     /  
  Mean  
  /     \  
Diff   Diff
→ Ratio = Reverse of differences
```

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Match Like Terms

For Milk:Water problems, always compare **same component** (milk with milk, not water).

---

### ✅ Trick 3: Convert to Fractions First

If ratios are given, convert to **fraction values** before applying alligation:
- Milk:Water = 3:2 → Milk = 3/5  
- Use only one component for comparison

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Use in Percentage Problems

Population, interest, or discount problems can also be solved by alligation if:
- You know increase/decrease percentages
- You know the overall average or value

---

### ✅ Trick 5: Use Alligation in Reverse

If you're given the result and one component, use reverse alligation to find unknown ratios or values.

With these simple rules and fast crow techniques, you can solve a wide range of mixture and comparison problems in seconds!
