## Time and Distance

---

## 🧭 Basic Concepts

### 🔹 Speed, Time, and Distance Formula

The relationship among speed, time, and distance is:

```
Distance = Speed × Time  
Speed = Distance ÷ Time  
Time = Distance ÷ Speed
```

---

## 📏 Units of Measurement

- Distance: meters (m), kilometers (km), miles
- Time: seconds (sec), minutes (min), hours (hr)
- Speed: km/h, m/s

---

## 🔄 Unit Conversions

- 1 km = 1000 m  
- 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds  
- To convert **km/h to m/s**: multiply by `5/18`  
- To convert **m/s to km/h**: multiply by `18/5`

---

## 🚗 Example Problems

### Example 1: Difference in Speed

Dimple drives at 90 km/h, Sachin at 108 km/h.  
Find the difference in speed in **m/s**:

```
Difference = (108 - 90) km/h = 18 km/h  
→ 18 × (5/18) = 5 m/s
```

---

### Example 2: Round Trip with Different Speeds

A student goes to school at 5 km/h and returns at 4 km/h.  
Total time taken is 4 hours. What is the total distance?

```
Average Speed (when distance is same) = (2 × 5 × 4) ÷ (5 + 4) = 4.44 km/h  
Distance = 4.44 × 4 = ~17.78 km
```

---

### Example 3: Relative Speed

Two people running in **opposite directions**:  
- One runs at 7 m/s  
- Other at 5 m/s  
→ Relative Speed = 7 + 5 = 12 m/s

If gap is 150 meters, time to meet = 150 ÷ 12 = **12.5 seconds**

---

## 🚉 Train-Based Problems

- When a train passes a **man or pole**:  
  Time = Length ÷ Speed

- When a train passes a **platform or another train**:  
  Total length = Train length + Platform length

**Example:**  
A 280 m train crosses a 220 m platform at 60 km/h.  
Total length = 500 m  
Speed = 60 × 1000 ÷ 3600 = 16.67 m/s  
Time = 500 ÷ 16.67 ≈ **30 seconds**

---

## 🧮 Average Speed

### Case 1: Distance Same, Different Speeds  
```
Average Speed = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) ÷ (Speed1 + Speed2)
```

**Example:**  
A car travels at 60 km/h, returns at 40 km/h.  
Average speed = (2×60×40)/(60+40) = 48 km/h

---

## 🏁 Race and Head Start

If A gives B a **start of 100 meters** in a 1000m race,  
then A covers 1000 m while B covers only 900 m in same time.

If A beats B by **10 seconds**, then  
- A’s time = T  
- B’s time = T + 10

Use time and speed ratios to compare their performance.

---

## 🔄 Circular Motion

If two people run on a circular track:

- In **same direction**:  
  Relative speed = Speed1 - Speed2  
- In **opposite direction**:  
  Relative speed = Speed1 + Speed2

To find when they meet again at start:
```
Time = LCM(Time taken individually for one round)
```

## 🧠 Crow Techniques (Fast Shortcuts)

---

### ✅ Trick 1: Speed in m/s from km/h

Just multiply by `5/18`

**Example:**  
90 km/h = 90 × 5/18 = **25 m/s**

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Train Crossing Time

Use this formula:  
```
Time = (Train length + Object length) ÷ Speed in m/s
```

---

### ✅ Trick 3: Average Speed for Round Trip

If same distance is traveled with two different speeds:
```
Average = (2 × Speed1 × Speed2) ÷ (Speed1 + Speed2)
```

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Meeting Point from Two Cities

If A and B start from two places and meet after time t:  
→ Use:  
```
Distance = (Speed1 + Speed2) × Time
```

---

### ✅ Trick 5: Head Start in Race

If A gives B x meters head start and both run at different speeds,  
use speed ratios to find total distance and who finishes first.

---

### ✅ Trick 6: Relative Speed

- **Same Direction**: Subtract speeds  
- **Opposite Direction**: Add speeds

Use this to calculate when they meet or overtake.

---

### ✅ Trick 7: Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Always keep units consistent.  
If speed is in km/h and distance in meters, convert speed to m/s before solving.

With these tricks, solving Time and Distance problems becomes easy, fun, and super fast!
