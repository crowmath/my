## Time and Work

---

## 📘 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Basic Formula

```
Work = Efficiency × Time
Time = Work ÷ Efficiency
Efficiency = Work ÷ Time
```

- Work is usually taken as a whole = 1 unit  
- Efficiency means how much work one can do in one day

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Individual and Combined Work

### 🔹 A and B Together

If:
- A can do a job in 12 days  
- B can do the same job in 18 days  

Then:
```
A's efficiency = 1/12  
B's efficiency = 1/18  
Combined = 1/12 + 1/18 = (5/36)  
So, work done together = 36 ÷ 5 = 7.2 days
```

---

### 🔹 A, B, and C Together

If:
- A can finish in 12 days  
- B in 15 days  
- C in 20 days  

Then:
```
A + B + C = (1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20)  
→ Take LCM = 60  
→ Add = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12  
→ So, work is done in 60 ÷ 12 = 5 days
```

---

### 🔹 Alternate Days Work

If A and B work on alternate days:
- A does 1/10 per day  
- B does 1/20 per day  
→ In 2 days = 1/10 + 1/20 = 3/20  
→ In 12 days = (3/20) × 6 = 18/20  
→ Left work = 2/20, done by A on 13th day  
→ Total days = **13**

---

## 🧮 Changing People During Work

If A leaves before work ends or someone joins after a few days, calculate work done day by day.

**Example:**  
A works 4 days, then B continues alone

- A's work in 4 days = 4 × (1/16) = 1/4  
- Remaining work = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4  
- B completes it in: (3/4) ÷ (1/12) = 9 days  
→ Total = 4 + 9 = **13 days**

---

## 🔁 Using Efficiency Ratios

If A is twice as efficient as B:
- A:B = 2:1 → Time taken is 1:2

**Example:**  
If A & B complete work in 75 days, A is 3× as fast  
→ Total work = (3+1)×75 = 300  
→ A alone = 300 ÷ 3 = **100 days**

---

## 📐 Special Formulas

### 1. A & B together = x days  
   A alone = x + a days  
   B alone = x + b days  
Then:  
```
x = √(a × b)
```

---

### 2. A works d days less or more than B  
Use the equation:  
```
(A + B)'s total = A’s partial work + B’s remaining
```

---

## 🔩 Man-Day-Hour Concept

```
Work = Men × Days × Hours
```

If more people or more hours → less time needed.

---

**Example:**  
18 people × 10 days × 8 hours = 1440 units  
If 25 people × x days × 6 hours = 2400  
→ x = 16 days

---

## 💰 Wages and Work Sharing

Wages are divided based on **efficiency**

**Example:**  
If A's efficiency is 5× B's and total payment is ₹18,000:  
- Ratio = 5:1  
- Total days = 15  
- Daily = 18000 ÷ 15 = 1200  
- A’s share = (5/6) × 1200 = **₹1000 per day**

## 🧠 Crow Techniques (Shortcuts)

---

### ✅ Trick 1: Total Work as LCM  
Always take LCM of number of days to find "Total Work".  
Then assign daily efficiency and solve easily.

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Efficiency is Inverse of Time  
If A is faster than B, their efficiency ratio is:
```
Efficiency of A : B = Time of B : Time of A
```

---

### ✅ Trick 3: For Alternating Days  
Calculate work in every 2-day pair and repeat it till near total work.  
Then handle leftover with the person whose turn it is.

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Use Ratio for Man-Day Problems  
If 35 men do it in 6 days, and we need to know how many days for 7 men:
```
35 × 6 = 7 × x  
→ x = 30 days
```

For half work, just divide answer by 2 → x = 15 days

---

### ✅ Trick 5: A Leaves Before End  
Use:
```
Total Work = (A + B’s combined work × total days) – (A’s contribution)
```

---

### ✅ Trick 6: Combined Work Using Formula  
If:
```
A does in x days  
B in y days  
C in z days  
Then total = (xyz) ÷ (xy + yz + zx)
```

---

### ✅ Trick 7: Payment Share by Efficiency  
Wages are split in the same ratio as efficiency.
