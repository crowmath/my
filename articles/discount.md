## üõí What is a Discount?

A **discount** is the reduction given on the **Marked Price (MP)** of an item.  
It is usually given as a percentage.

```
Discount = Marked Price - Selling Price  
Discount % = (Discount / Marked Price) √ó 100
```

üìå **Note:**  
- Discount is always calculated **on the Marked Price**
- If no discount is given, then **MP = SP**

---

## üîπ Types of Discount Problems

### 1. **Single Discount**

If a product has a marked price of ‚Çπ1000 and a discount of 20%:

```
Discount = 20% of 1000 = ‚Çπ200  
Selling Price = MP - Discount = 1000 - 200 = ‚Çπ800
```

---

### 2. **Successive Discounts**

Two or more discounts are given one after another.  
Use the formula:

```
Net Discount % = x + y - (x √ó y) / 100
```

**Example:**  
Discounts: 10% and 20%

```
Net Discount = 10 + 20 - (10√ó20)/100 = 28%
```

---

### 3. **Three Successive Discounts**

Formula:
```
Net Discount % = a + b + c - (ab + bc + ca)/100 + (abc)/10000
```

**Example:**  
10%, 20%, and 25%  
You can also use step-by-step:

```
Step 1: MP √ó (90/100)  
Step 2: Result √ó (80/100)  
Step 3: Result √ó (75/100)  
Final = SP  
Then SP = MP √ó (90√ó80√ó75) / 100¬≥
```

---

### 4. **Free Articles as Discount**

When some articles are given free with others.

**Formula:**
```
Discount % = (Free Items √ó 100) / (Total Items)
```

**Example:**  
Buy 24, get 6 free  
‚Üí Total = 30  
‚Üí Discount % = (6 √ó 100) / 30 = **20%**

---

### 5. **Alligation-Based Discount**

Used when two different discounts are given on different parts of total price.

**Example:**
- MP of 2 watches = ‚Çπ2100  
- One at 8%, other at 15%  
- Overall discount = 12%

Use alligation to find MP difference:
```
8%     15%  
   \   /
    12%  
   /   \
3         4

Ratio = 4:3 ‚Üí 4 parts at 8%, 3 parts at 15%
‚Üí Difference in MP = Apply ratio to ‚Çπ2100
```

---

## üí∞ Important Relations

- If a dealer gives 18% discount and gains 24%, and CP = ‚Çπ1560:

Use formula:
```
MP = (CP √ó 100 + Profit %) / (100 - Discount %)

MP = (1560 √ó 124) / 82 = ‚Çπ2359
```

---

## üî¢ Example: Reverse Calculation

If SP is ‚Çπ2592 and discounts are 10%, 20%, and 25%:

```
Let MP = x  
SP = x √ó (90/100) √ó (80/100) √ó (75/100) = 2592  
Solve for x ‚Üí MP = ‚Çπ4800
```

# üß† Crow Techniques (Shortcuts)

---

### ‚úÖ Trick 1: Successive Discount Formula  
```
Net % = x + y - (x √ó y)/100
```
Use for two back-to-back discounts.

---

### ‚úÖ Trick 2: Multiply Series for Multiple Discounts  
For 3 discounts:
```
SP = MP √ó (100 - D‚ÇÅ)% √ó (100 - D‚ÇÇ)% √ó (100 - D‚ÇÉ)% / 100¬≥
```

---

### ‚úÖ Trick 3: Use Free Item Discount Formula  
```
Discount % = (Free √ó 100) / (Free + Paid)
```

**Example:** Buy 2 get 1 free ‚Üí (1√ó100)/(2+1) = 33.33%

---

### ‚úÖ Trick 4: Best Offer Comparison  
Use effective discount formulas to compare offers like:
- 25% & 15% = 36.25%
- 30% & 10% = 37%
- 35% & 5% = 38.25%  
So the **third offer is best**.

---

### ‚úÖ Trick 5: Fast Alligation Setup  
Use alligation when two items have different discount % and total discount is given.  
Set up this:

```
D1     D2  
   \   /
    D  
   /   \
Diff2  Diff1  
‚Üí Ratio = Diff2 : Diff1
```
