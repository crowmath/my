# Profit and Loss ‚Äì Complete Concepts and Tricks

---

## üìò Basic Definitions

- **Cost Price (CP)** ‚Äì The price at which an article is bought.
- **Selling Price (SP)** ‚Äì The price at which it is sold.
- **Profit** ‚Äì If SP > CP ‚Üí Profit = SP - CP
- **Loss** ‚Äì If CP > SP ‚Üí Loss = CP - SP

---

## üìä Profit and Loss Percentage

- **Profit %** = `(Profit / CP) √ó 100`
- **Loss %** = `(Loss / CP) √ó 100`

**Example:**

> A product bought at ‚Çπ20 and sold at ‚Çπ50:  
Profit = ‚Çπ30  
Profit % = `(30 / 20) √ó 100 = 150%`

---

## üßÆ Finding Cost Price or Selling Price

- If **SP** and **Profit %** given:
  ```
  CP = [SP √ó 100] / (100 + Profit %)
  ```

- If **SP** and **Loss %** given:
  ```
  CP = [SP √ó 100] / (100 - Loss %)
  ```

---

## ü™ô Special Case: CP of x Articles = SP of y Articles

- **Profit %** = `[(x - y)/y] √ó 100`  
- **Loss %** = `[(y - x)/y] √ó 100`

**Example:**  
If CP of 15 = SP of 10  
‚Üí Profit % = `(15 - 10)/10 √ó 100 = 50%`

---

## üìè Loss and Profit on Same SP ‚Äì Combined Profit/Loss

If 2 articles sold at same SP with gain x% and loss y%:

```
Net P/L % = [100(x - y) + 2xy] / (200 + x - y)
```

**Example:**  
> One item sold at 25% gain and another at 20% loss, same SP = ‚Çπ1599  
Result:
```
Net % = [100(25 - 20) + 2√ó25√ó(-20)] / (200 + 25 - 20) = -5.07% ‚Üí Loss
```

---

## üîÅ Profit Equal to Loss

If profit made on SP1 is equal to loss on SP2:

```
Cost Price = (SP1 + SP2) / 2
```

---

## üõí Profit Calculated on Selling Price

If profit % is x% on SP:

```
Profit % on CP = (x / (100 - x)) √ó 100
```

---

## ‚öñ Dishonest Shopkeeper Using False Weights

If shopkeeper gives less weight but charges full price:

```
Profit % = [(True Weight - False Weight) / False Weight] √ó 100
```

**Example:**  
If 30% less weight is used:  
Profit % = `(100 - 70)/70 √ó 100 = 42.86%`

---

## üß∫ Selling Multiple Items ‚Äì Quantity Ratio Problems

Use proportion:
```
(SP‚ÇÅ / (100 ¬± Loss%)) = (SP‚ÇÇ / (100 ¬± Profit%))
```

**Example:**  
Trader sells 3 dozen oranges for ‚Çπ405 at 25% loss.  
How many to sell for ‚Çπ288 to earn 20% profit?

```
405 / 75 = 288 / 120 ‚Üí Cross-multiply and solve.
```

---

## üß† Average Profit When CP Is Same

Average % = `(Total Profit% - Loss%) / No. of Articles`

**Example:**  
15%, 12% gain and 15% loss on three items  
‚Üí Net % = `(15 + 12 - 15) / 3 = 4%`

---

## üßæ Discount and Marked Price Concepts

- **Discount %** = `(MP - SP) / MP √ó 100`
- Successive Discounts:  
  If two successive discounts are x% and y%, then:  
  ```
  Effective Discount = x + y - (xy / 100)
  ```

**Example:**  
Successive discounts of 15% and 25%  
‚Üí `15 + 25 - (15√ó25)/100 = 36.25%`

---

## üß† Crow Techniques (Shortcut Methods)

---

### üîπ Technique 1: Profit on Selling Price

If Profit % is given on SP, convert using:
```
Profit % on CP = (x / (100 - x)) √ó 100
```

---

### üîπ Technique 2: Equal Selling Price Case

For one item at x% gain and another at y% loss (same SP):
```
Net % = [100(x - y) + 2xy] / (200 + x - y)
```

---

### üîπ Technique 3: CP = Average of Two SPs

If profit on SP1 equals loss on SP2, then:
```
CP = (SP1 + SP2) / 2
```

---

### üîπ Technique 4: False Weight Profit

Use:
```
Profit % = (Weight Difference / False Weight) √ó 100
```

---

### üîπ Technique 5: Successive Discount Shortcut

If successive discounts are `d1` and `d2`, then:
```
Effective Discount = d1 + d2 - (d1√ód2)/100
```

---

### üîπ Technique 6: Two Products with Same CP

Average % profit/loss = (Sum of % values) / Number of products

---

### üîπ Technique 7: Ratio-Based Quantity Problems

Use basic ratio solving and proportionality between CP and SP.

---

### üîπ Technique 8: MP-Discount-Profit Formula

If discount and profit % are both given:

```
MP = (CP √ó 100) / [(100 - D%) / (100 + P%)]
```

## üìù Summary

| Concept | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Profit % | (Profit / CP) √ó 100 |
| Loss % | (Loss / CP) √ó 100 |
| CP from SP | SP √ó 100 / (100 + Profit%) |
| False weight profit | (Difference / False Weight) √ó 100 |
| Equal SP profit/loss | Net % = [100(x - y) + 2xy] / (200 + x - y) |
| Successive Discounts | d1 + d2 - (d1√ód2)/100 |
