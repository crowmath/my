## 📘 What is Percentage?

- A percentage is a number out of **100**
- The symbol `%` means **per hundred**

**Examples:**
- 37% means 37 out of 100 → `37/100`
- 25% of 200 = `(25/100) × 200 = 50`

---

## 🔹 Basic Formulae

- **y% of x = (y/100) × x**
- **x is what % of y = (x/y) × 100**
- **% Increase = (Increase ÷ Original) × 100**
- **% Decrease = (Decrease ÷ Original) × 100**

---

### 🔹 Example Problems

**1.** What is 30% of 600?  
→ `(30/100) × 600 = 180`

**2.** 180 is what percent of 125?  
→ `(180/125) × 100 = 144%`

**3.** 40 is what % of 160?  
→ `(40/160) × 100 = 25%`

**4.** 24 is what % more than 20?  
→ `(4/20) × 100 = 20%`

## 🔁 Successive Percentage Changes

If a number is increased by **a%** and then decreased by **b%**:

```
Net Change = a - b - (ab/100)
```

**Example:** Increase by 20%, then decrease by 20%  
→ Net change = 20 - 20 - (20×20)/100 = -4%  
→ Final value decreases by 4%

## 🔢 Special Examples

### Finding Mixed % of a Number

**Find 111% of 500:**  
→ 100% + 10% + 1%  
→ 500 + 50 + 5 = **555**

## 🏗️ Application to Geometry

**Length and Breadth Increase:**
If length ↑ 10%, breadth ↑ 20%  
→ Area ↑ by:  
`10 + 20 + (10×20)/100 = 32%`

**Base ↑ by 33%, height ↓ by 16.66%**  
→ Area % change = `33 - 16.66 - (33×16.66)/100 ≈ 13%`

## 📊 Election/Income/Savings Based

**A wins by 1200 votes with 60% of valid votes out of 10,000 total votes.**  
→ Valid votes = 90% of 10,000 = 9,000  
→ B gets 40% of 9,000 = 3,600  
→ A gets 5,400  
→ Margin = 5,400 - 3,600 = 1,800 ✔

# 🧠 Crow Techniques (Fast Shortcuts)

---

### ✅ Trick 1: Quick % of Numbers

**x% of y = y% of x**  
→ 10% of 20 = 2 = 20% of 10

---

### ✅ Trick 2: Fractions to % Quickly

Memorize:

- 1/2 = 50%  
- 1/3 ≈ 33.33%  
- 1/5 = 20%  
- 1/8 = 12.5%

---

### ✅ Trick 3: Successive % Changes

Use this formula when applying two % changes in a row:

```
Net % = a + b + (ab/100)
```

If one % is negative, just plug in with minus sign.

---

### ✅ Trick 4: Compare Two Values with %

To find how much more/less:

```
% = (Difference ÷ Original) × 100
```

---

### ✅ Trick 5: Apply Ratio Method

For mixed percentages like 33⅓% and 16⅔%, convert to ratios:
- 33⅓% = 1/3  
- 16⅔% = 1/6  
- Multiply areas or volumes directly with (1 + ratio)

---

### ✅ Trick 6: Consumption & Price

If price ↑ by A%, find % decrease in consumption to keep cost same:
```
Decrease % = [A / (100 + A)] × 100
```

---

### ✅ Trick 7: Repeated Increase/Decrease

If a value is increased and decreased by same %, net result is:
```
Loss = (x² / 100)%
```
