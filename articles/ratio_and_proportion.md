# Ratio & Proportion

---

## ðŸ“˜ What is a Ratio?

A **ratio** is a comparison between two numbers.  
It tells us **how many times** one number contains another.

**Example:**
- If there are 2 boys and 3 girls, the ratio is `2:3`

---

## ðŸ§® What is a Proportion?

A **proportion** is an equation showing that two ratios are equal.

**Example:**
- 2:3 = 4:6 â†’ Both are same ratio (simplify 4:6 = 2:3)

## ðŸ”¢ Types of Proportion

### 1. **First Proportion**
If `a:x = b:c` â†’  
```
x = (a Ã— c) / b
```

### 2. **Second Proportion**
If `a:b = x:c` â†’  
```
x = (b Ã— c) / a
```

### 3. **Third Proportion**
If `a:b = b:x` â†’  
```
x = bÂ² / a
```

### 4. **Fourth Proportion**
If `a:b = c:x` â†’  
```
x = (b Ã— c) / a
```

### 5. **Mean Proportion**
Between two numbers `a` and `b`:  
```
x = âˆš(a Ã— b)
```

## âž• Addition/Subtraction in Proportion

### Add x to make 4 numbers proportional:
If we add x to each of a, b, c, d, and they become proportional:

```
x = (bc - ad) / [(a + d) - (b + c)]
```

### Subtract x to make proportional:
```
x = (ad - bc) / [(a + d) - (b + c)]
```

## ðŸ§“ Age-Based Ratio Problems

If age ratios are given for different time periods, use:
- Difference in units = Difference in years  
- Find 1 unit value  
- Calculate present age from the ratio

**Example:**
5 years ago, A:B = 4:5  
5 years later, A:B = 6:7  
â†’ 2 unit = 10 years  
â†’ 1 unit = 5 years  
â†’ Present age of A = 6Ã—5 - 5 = 25

## ðŸ’° Income & Savings

If ratio of income and expenditure are given:

**Savings = Income - Expenditure**  
Use unit method to solve quickly.

---

## ðŸ’¼ Coins or Value-Based Ratio

If coin value ratios are given:
- Convert to coin counts if required
- Use total or part values to calculate the missing part

**Example:**  
Ratio of 50p, 25p, â‚¹1 coins = 5:8:1  
â†’ Convert values to a common unit (e.g. paisa)  
â†’ Use ratios and solve total accordingly

---

## ðŸ“Š Examples from Daily Life

### Sharing Money in Ratios
A, B, C share â‚¹10,500 in 5:7:9  
â†’ Total parts = 21  
â†’ Each part = 10500 / 21 = â‚¹500  
â†’ Shares: A = â‚¹2500, B = â‚¹3500, C = â‚¹4500

---

### Adjusted Ratio with Extra Amount

If each gets â‚¹500 extra, new ratio becomes 6:8:10  
â†’ Reduced to 3:4:5 for simplicity

### âœ… Trick 1: Multiply All Ratios to Get Combined Ratio

If:
```
a:b = 2:3, b:c = 3:4, c:d = 4:5  
â†’ a:b:c:d = 2:3:4:5
```

---

### âœ… Trick 2: Use LCM for Ratio Numbers

To handle ratios like 2:3 and 4:5:
- Make middle terms same using LCM  
- Adjust and combine the full ratio

---

### âœ… Trick 3: Age Problems with Ratio

If age ratio changes over time:
- Use difference in years to find value of 1 unit
- Then calculate actual ages using ratio

---

### âœ… Trick 4: Reverse Proportion Questions

When ratios are mixed wrongly, find actual vs mistaken ratio  
â†’ Check who gains or loses  
â†’ Use value difference to find who gained most

---

### âœ… Trick 5: Proportion After Addition/Subtraction

Use formulas:

- **After Addition:**
  ```
  x = (bc - ad) / [(a + d) - (b + c)]
  ```

- **After Subtraction:**
  ```
  x = (ad - bc) / [(a + d) - (b + c)]
  ```

---

### âœ… Trick 6: Coins and Values

When coin values are in a ratio (e.g., 5:10:20),  
the **number of coins** is the **inverse** of their values  
â†’ Use this for finding how many of each type
